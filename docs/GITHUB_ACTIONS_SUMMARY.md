## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .github/
git commit -m "ci: add GitHub Actions workflows"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Set Up Labels (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not installed
# brew install gh  (macOS)
# Or download from: https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Create labels
./.github/setup-labels.sh
```

### 3. Watch It Run!

Go to your repository → **Actions** tab to see workflows running.

## 🎯 What Each Workflow Does

### 1. **CI/CD Pipeline** (`ci.yml`)
**Runs on**: Every push and PR to `main`/`develop`

**Jobs** (runs in parallel):
- ✅ **Lint** - Code quality with `ruff`
- 🔒 **Security** - Vulnerability scanning (safety, bandit, trufflehog)
- 🏥 **Health Check** - Runs your existing health check script
- 🐳 **Docker Build** - Builds and tests Docker image
- 📝 **Type Check** - Type checking with `mypy`
- 📈 **Test Coverage** - Runs tests and generates coverage
- 📋 **Summary** - Aggregates all results

**Result**: You get immediate feedback if code breaks anything!

---

### 2. **PR Checks** (`pr-checks.yml`)
**Runs on**: Pull requests (opened, updated)

**Features**:
- ✅ Validates PR title (conventional commits format)
- 🏷️ Auto-labels PR based on changed files
  - `documentation`, `ui`, `backend`, `config`, etc.
- 📏 Adds size labels (`size/xs`, `size/s`, `size/m`, `size/l`, `size/xl`)
- 💬 Posts welcome comment for first-time contributors
- ⚠️ Warns if features changed without docs update

**Result**: PRs are organized and validated automatically!

---

### 3. **Docker Publish** (`docker-publish.yml`)
**Runs on**: Release published, manual trigger

**What it does**:
- 🐳 Builds Docker image
- 📦 Pushes to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`)
- 📋 Generates SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- 🔍 Scans for vulnerabilities with Trivy
- 📊 Uploads scan results to Security tab

**Tags created**:
- `ghcr.io/your-username/repo:latest`
- `ghcr.io/your-username/repo:v1.0.0`
- `ghcr.io/your-username/repo:sha-abc123`

**Result**: Production-ready Docker images with security scanning!

---

### 4. **Dependency Updates** (`dependency-update.yml`)
**Runs on**: Every Monday at 9 AM UTC

**What it does**:
- 📦 Updates all dependencies with `uv lock --upgrade`
- 🧪 Runs health check to verify compatibility
- 📝 Creates automated PR with updates
- 🏷️ Labels PR as `dependencies` and `automated`

**Result**: Never miss dependency updates, stay secure!

---

### 5. **Performance Monitoring** (`performance.yml`)
**Runs on**: Push to `main`, PRs

**What it analyzes**:
- 🔄 Cyclomatic complexity (code complexity)
- 📊 Maintainability index (0-100 score)
- ⏱️ Docker build time
- 📦 Docker image size

**Result**: Track code quality over time!

---

## 📊 Expected CI Results

When you push code, you'll see something like this in the Actions tab:

```
CI/CD Pipeline
├─ ✅ Lint                    (45s)
├─ ✅ Security               (1m 20s)
├─ ✅ Health Check           (30s)
├─ ✅ Docker Build           (3m 15s)
├─ ⚠️  Type Check            (1m 5s) - warnings ok
├─ ⚠️  Test Coverage         (25s) - 0% (no tests yet)
└─ ✅ Summary                (10s)

Total time: 8m 32s
Status: ✅ PASSED
```

## 🏷️ Auto-Labeling Examples

When you create a PR:

**Changed files**: `pages/1_Basic_Chatbot.py` (50 lines)
**Labels applied**: `ui`, `size/s`

**Changed files**: `langchain_helpers.py`, `config.py` (300 lines)
**Labels applied**: `backend`, `config`, `size/m`

**Changed files**: `CLAUDE.md` (10 lines)
**Labels applied**: `documentation`, `size/xs`

## 🔐 Security Features

Your pipeline includes multiple security layers:

1. **Dependency Scanning** (Safety)
   - Checks for known vulnerabilities in Python packages

2. **Code Security** (Bandit)
   - Detects common security issues in Python code

3. **Secret Detection** (Trufflehog)
   - Prevents accidentally committed API keys/secrets

4. **Container Scanning** (Trivy)
   - Scans Docker images for OS and package vulnerabilities

5. **Dependency Review** (GitHub)
   - Reviews new dependencies in PRs for security issues

All security findings appear in: **Security** tab → **Code scanning alerts**

## 📈 Monitoring Your CI/CD

### View Workflow Runs
```bash
# List recent runs
gh run list

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>

# View logs
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

### Check Workflow Status
```bash
# See all workflows
gh workflow list

# View specific workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit 10
```

### Re-run Failed Jobs
```bash
# Re-run failed jobs
gh run rerun <run-id> --failed

# Re-run entire workflow
gh run rerun <run-id>
```

## 🎓 Common Workflows

### Creating a Feature

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/my-feature

# 2. Make changes, commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push origin feat/my-feature

# 4. Create PR (auto-triggers PR checks)
gh pr create --title "feat: add new feature" --body "Description here"

# 5. CI runs automatically on PR
# 6. Fix any issues
# 7. Merge when green ✅
```

### Creating a Release

```bash
# 1. Create and push tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# 2. Create GitHub release (triggers Docker publish)
gh release create v1.0.0 \
  --title "v1.0.0" \
  --notes "Release notes here"

# 3. Docker image published automatically to:
#    ghcr.io/your-username/repo:v1.0.0
#    ghcr.io/your-username/repo:latest
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails on First Run

**Common issues**:
1. Labels don't exist → Run `.github/setup-labels.sh`
2. Syntax error in workflow → Check YAML indentation
3. Missing permissions → Add `permissions:` to workflow

### Docker Build Fails

**Solutions**:
- Check Docker Compose syntax
- Verify Dockerfile exists
- Check for memory/timeout issues

### Auto-Labeling Not Working

**Solutions**:
- Verify `.github/labeler.yml` exists
- Check labels exist in repo
- Ensure workflow has `pull-requests: write` permission

---

## 📚 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Push workflows to GitHub
2. ✅ Run label setup script
3. ✅ Create a test PR to see auto-labeling

### Short Term
1. Add unit tests (improve coverage from 0%)
2. Configure secrets for integration tests
3. Create first release to test Docker publishing

### Long Term
1. Add more test coverage
2. Set up branch protection rules
3. Configure Dependabot
4. Add code owners file
